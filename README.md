## üì∞ What is RSS?
RSS (Rich Site Summary) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitors sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them.

If you're interested in using RSS feeds to stay up-to-date on your favorite websites, **V - RSS Reader** is the perfect solution. You can download it for free from the Google Play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vrssreader.app).
